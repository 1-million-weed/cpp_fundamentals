**Give short (1-2 sentences) answers to the following questions**

1. In C++, what's the difference between a declaration and a definition?
- Declarations tell the compiler that something exists, without providing implemetation or allocating memory
- Definitions create avariable or provide implementation for a function or class, allocating memmory.

2. What are header files used for?
Header files allow for code reuse. Multiple files can use the same header to to use that header's declarations. Iostream is the standard c++ header file, providing declarations for cin, cout etc.

3. When a compiler creates a program, in what part of the construction process does it use header files and in what part libraries? (Answer the question by focusing on the fact that the compiler uses header files and libraries.)
4. Is a library an object module? Explain, and do not just answer yes or no.
5. Why is an object file obtained after compiling a source containing int main() not an executable program?
